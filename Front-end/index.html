        <h2>History</h2>

            <img id="first" src="first.jpg" alt="">
            The origins of Gotham City are somewhat shrouded in mystery. 
            Many millennia ago, an evil warlock was buried alive beneath 
            what would one day become the central island of Gotham. It is 
            alleged that while the warlock laid in a state of torpor, his 
            evil essence seeped into the soil, poisoning the ground with his 
            dark, corrupt touch. By the warlock's own reasoning, he claims that 
            he fathered the modern spirit of Gotham City and has even taken to 
            calling himself Doctor Gotham</p>

        <h2>No Man's Land</h2>
        <p id="longp"><img id="second" src="second.jpg" alt="">
        Shortly following Ra's al Ghul's attempt to contaminate Gotham with a 
            deadly virus, the city suffered an magnitude 7.6 earthquake in an event 
            commonly referred to as the "Cataclysm". With hopes for rehabilitating 
            the broken city, the United States government declared it a "No Man's Land," 
            which effectively quarantined the entire island city. Eventually, thanks in no 
            small part to the financial and political machinations of Lex Luthor — dipping 
            his hands, as ever, in both legitimate and illegal means to achieve his goals — 
            Gotham City was released and rebuilt, and rejoined the United States.</p>
